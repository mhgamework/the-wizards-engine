-----------
When using the wizards dlls, this must done:


add to the app.config file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
    <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0"/>
  </startup>
</configuration>


----Must install:

Nvidia PhysX
XNA 2.0 Redist 
SlimDX SDK for development or Redist (Not Tested)
DevExpress 10.1.5.0 (research patched version by Danny Su)
DirectX SDK (apparently)

Visual C++ 2008 redistributable package (NOT SP1)

PostSharp in the /_Libraries folder must be installed to develop



----DEBUG:
Currently The Wizards is using Debug StillDesign.PhysX libaries. They use the Debug Visual C++ 2008 libraries, which are only installed by VS 2008.

With some renaming and file collection from windows/winsxs , these dlls have been located along with their manifest. 

Solution: Add these files to the executables folder:

_Libraries\VC++ 2008 DEBUG(NO SP1)

WARNING: when using retail StillDesign.PhysX, these files should probably be removed!
