    <p>
        This contains the tests for the SkyMerchant project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stable: Contains all the stable tests and features in the wizards. This should serve as a documentation source for the features you can use in this project<br />
            Tests that have &#39;DOCUMENTATION&#39; in their comment are tests that should be considered documenting the features.</li>
        <li>Development: Tests being worked on, not yet useable as documentation or maybe not operational</li>
        <li>Unused: working features, but not used or required anymore for the project</li>
        <li>Broken: simply partially implemented code, or code broken somewhere along the line. Might not be usefull, or might need refactoring.</li>
