        Contains information about the automated testing project design.</p>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The automated testing project will allow user to <strong>mark </strong>objects. Marking indicates that at that point in the execution, the object&#39;s state should be fixed across multiple test runs. If the state of this object is identical to a stored &#39;correct&#39; state, the test is considered successful.</p>
    <p>
        The engine will provide tools to manually validate the state at this points, so that you don&#39;t have to recreate these states by hand, testing them is good enough. This means that there is a user mode and a automated mode.</p>
    <h1>Ideas</h1>
    <p>
        Depending on the type of the marked object, a specific visualization can be made. There should be a way to add specific test visualizations for data types.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IMesh: render mesh</li>
        <li>Framebuffer: show buffer</li>
        <li>Matrix: show decomposed text + axis</li>
        <li>Objects: show text based, or graph based?</li>
    </ul>

        Extend NUnit using NUnit addins in order to decorate tests with more behaviour.</p>
    <p>
        Resharper supports NUnit addins. Just use a nunit installation inside the source root, add addins into the /addins folder, and use this installation with resharper (store settings with solution) <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Reference__Options__Tools__Unit_Testing__NUnit.html">http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Reference__Options__Tools__Unit_Testing__NUnit.html</a><br />
        Use a SuiteBuilder extension point to build NUnit test suits for another attribute than [TestFixture]</p>
