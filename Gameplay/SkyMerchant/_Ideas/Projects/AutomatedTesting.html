        Contains information about the automated testing project design.</p>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The automated testing project will allow user to <strong>mark </strong>objects. Marking indicates that at that point in the execution, the object&#39;s state should be fixed across multiple test runs. If the state of this object is identical to a stored &#39;correct&#39; state, the test is considered successful.</p>
    <p>
        The engine will provide tools to manually validate the state at this points, so that you don&#39;t have to recreate these states by hand, testing them is good enough. This means that there is a user mode and a automated mode.</p>
    <h1>Ideas</h1>
    <p>
        Depending on the type of the marked object, a specific visualization can be made. There should be a way to add specific test visualizations for data types.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IMesh: render mesh</li>
        <li>Framebuffer: show buffer</li>
        <li>Matrix: show decomposed text + axis</li>
        <li>Objects: show text based, or graph based?</li>
    </ul>
