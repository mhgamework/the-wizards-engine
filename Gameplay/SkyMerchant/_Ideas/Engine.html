    <h1>
        Engine</h1>
    <p>
        Contains ideas for adding to the engine.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Show the percentage of 16ms (60FPS) the frame is currently using. This is a much more interesting number. </p>
    <p>
        When marking objects for automated testing, a correct visualization can be chosen depending on the type! This might make tests a whole lot easier: Meshes are automatically visualized, frame buffers are paused to check the correctness, normal objects can be tree visualized, or converted to text, matrix visualization
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;Add a feature to render a full frame in steps of 30ms, in order to render large scenes without lod for previews.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Focus more on a component based design <a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/</a> (eg cleanly list all components seperately)</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Add a text face renderer (2 sided?)</p>
    <p>
        Visualize objects tree in 3D by showing a 2D graph, with text panels containing extra information. Can add lod to the panels, where the text changes from big name to more detailed</p>
    <p>
        Add automated test for hotloading! NEEDED becaus it always break</p>
    <p>
        Add some form of automated test running, at least starting the tests is good.</p>
    <p>
        Support running the engine without rendering window.</p>
    <p>
        Try using a build server, eg TeamCity.</p>
    <p>
        Allow DI construction on test fixtures, annotated with a special attribute (eg integration tests for the engine allow injecting engine stuff, <strong>integration tests for skymerchant allow injecting skymerchant stuff</strong>)</p>
