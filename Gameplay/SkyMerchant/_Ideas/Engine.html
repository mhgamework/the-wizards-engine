        Show the percentage of 16ms (60FPS) the frame is currently using. This is a much more interesting number. </p>

        When marking objects for automated testing, a correct visualization can be chosen depending on the type! This might make tests a whole lot easier: Meshes are automatically visualized, frame buffers are paused to check the correctness, normal objects can be tree visualized, or converted to text, matrix visualization
