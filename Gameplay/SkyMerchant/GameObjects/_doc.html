        Implements the GameObjects gameplay interfaces for the SkyMerchant Project.</p>
    <p>
        Game objects are composed by IGameObjectComponents. The IGameObjectRepository holds the game objects, and provides access to them.</p>
    <p>
        There is a windsor GameObjectScope which allows to set a current active game object, which is to be used to resolve IGameObjectComponents for DI.</p>
