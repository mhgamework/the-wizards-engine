    <h1>TeamCity</h1>
    <p>
        In order to make TeamCity work with TW, some fixes were needed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Include the nuget packages into the git, more specifically, the postsharp packages. Without these, the first compilation of the solution would fail</li>
        <li>Make sure the chosen solution build configuration has all the projects set on compile</li>
        <li>Make sure the project dependencies are correct. When references to other projects are done by file, these could be incorrect, causing the first build to fail.</li>
    </ul>
