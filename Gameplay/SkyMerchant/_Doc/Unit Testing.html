    <h1>Unit Testing</h1>
    <p>
        Current NUnit is used to run tests. There are tests in Unit Tests.dll, and in the Gameplay.dll, locally with the modules.</p>
    <p>
        Tests in the category &quot;RunsAutomated&quot; are tests that are able to run unattended (without user interaction), by the nunit-test runner</p>
    <p>
        assembly: Timout(5000) is used to set a global timeout of tests</p>
