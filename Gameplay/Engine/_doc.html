    <p>
        Contains The Wizards Engine IDE implementation. Should be moved to a seperate hotloadable gameplay dll.</p>
    <p>
        NUnit Tests can be run integrated into the engine by adding a EngineTestAttribute to the class. You should create an engine in the unit tests by using the EngineFactory.</p>
    
    <p>
        The goald workflow is: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start NewModules.exe. This is The Wizards Engine IDE. Keep this running at all times. (to be renamed)</li>
        <li>Open the solution for the hotloadable module you want to edit. There can be multiple modules for different gameplay features and they can have dependencies to eachother.</li>
        <li>Make changes in visual studio, then build. The engine will reload your code. Modules which are not reloaded keep their data in the system.</li>
    </ul>
