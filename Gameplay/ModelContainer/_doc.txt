This namespace contains the basic classes for the ModelContainer system.

Main idea is that all the data for the wizards gameplay is in 1 container.

A testcase for the modelcontainer is implemented, where data can be 'attached' to a modelobject. This relation is currently just a runtime organization mechanism.
