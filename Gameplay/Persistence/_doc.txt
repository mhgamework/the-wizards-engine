The Persistence namespace allows for automatic serialization of ModelObjects.

An IModelObject marked with the PersistAttribute will be automatically serialized and deserialized when the ModelContainer is saved/loaded

Currently, the entire Model is stored in a single line based file.

TODO: split this in some way? \\
TODO: maybe remove the 'heading numbers', to allow for git versioning (like in The Witness, cfr blog)
