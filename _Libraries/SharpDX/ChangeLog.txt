* [D3DCompiler] Bugfix on D3D_COMPILE_ENABLE_.* flags that were missing
* [Direct3D10/11] Bugfix mapping correction for Direct3D11/Direct3D10.1 RenderBlendDescription.RenderTargetWriteMask is now using ColorWriteMaskFlags 
* [Direct3D10/11] Bugfix D3D10/11_FILTER enums with correct naming (MIN abbreviation for Minification was wrongly automatically translated to Minimum)
* [Direct3D11] Make Direct3D11.Device.ImmediateContext released when Device is released. 
* [DXGI] Bugfix on DXGI.Output.GetDisplayModeList, failed if no display mode exist for a given mode
