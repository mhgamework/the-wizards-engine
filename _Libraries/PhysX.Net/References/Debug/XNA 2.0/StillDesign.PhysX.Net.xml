This member controls if a character controller will collide with another controller. There are 3 options:
always collide, never collide and collide based on the shape group.
This flag only affects other controllers when they move; when this controller moves, the flag is ignored
and the flags of the other controllers determine collision.

Convenience	function for easy	access to	the	text inside	an element.	Although easy

			If the first child of	'this' is	a	TiXmlText, the GetText()
			returns	the	character	string of	the	Text node, else	null is	returned.

			This is	a	convenient method	for	getting	the	text of	simple contained text:
			@verbatim
			<foo>This	is text</foo>
			const	char*	str	=	fooElement-&gt;GetText();
			@endverbatim

			'str'	will be	a	pointer	to "This is	text".

			Note that	this function	can	be misleading. If	the	element	foo	was	created	from
			this XML:
			@verbatim
			<foo><b>This is	text</b></foo>
			@endverbatim

			then the value of	str	would	be null. The first child node	isn't	a	text node, it	is
			another	element. From	this XML:

			safe type	casts	on the referenced	node.

\brief Class used to describe tire properties for a NxWheelShape.  A tire force function takes a measure for tire slip as input, (this is computed differently for lateral and longitudal directions) and gives a force (or in our implementation, an impulse) as output. The curve is approximated by a two piece cubic Hermite spline. The first section goes from (0,0) to (extremumSlip, extremumValue), at which point the curve's tangent is zero. The second section goes from (extremumSlip, extremumValue) to (asymptoteSlip, asymptoteValue), at which point the curve's tangent is again zero.

\brief This threshold is used by the collision detection to determine if a height field edge is convex and can generate contact points. Usually the convexity of an edge is determined from the angle (or cosine of the angle) between the normals of the faces sharing that edge. The height field allows a more efficient approach by comparing height values of neighbouring vertices. This parameter offsets the comparison. Smaller changes than 0.5 will not alter the set of convex edges. The rule of thumb is that larger values will result in fewer edge contacts.

\brief Flag that determines the combine mode. When two actors come in contact with each other, they each have materials with various coefficients, but we only need a single set of coefficients for the pair. Physics doesn't have any inherent combinations because the coefficients are determined empirically on a case by case basis. However, simulating this with a pairwise lookup table is often impractical. For this reason the following combine behaviors are available: NX_CM_AVERAGE NX_CM_MIN NX_CM_MULTIPLY NX_CM_MAX The effective combine mode for the pair is max(material0.combineMode, material1.combineMode).

        <member name="T:NxWheelShape">
\brief A special shape used for simulating a car wheel.

The -Y axis should be directed toward the ground.  A ray is cast from the shape's origin along the -Y axis.  

When the ray strikes something, and the distance is:

	\li less than wheelRadius from the shape origin: a hard contact is created
	\li between wheelRadius and (suspensionTravel + wheelRadius): a soft suspension contact is created
	\li greater than (suspensionTravel + wheelRadius): no contact is created.

Thus at the point of greatest possible suspension compression the wheel axle will pass through at the shape's origin.
At the point greatest suspension extension the wheel axle will be a distance of suspensionTravel from the shape's origin.

The suspension's targetValue is 0 for real cars, which means that the suspension tries to extend all the way.  Otherwise one can specify values
[0,1] for suspensions which have a spring to pull the wheel up when it is extended too far.  0.5 will then fall halfway along suspensionTravel.

The +Z axis is the 'forward' direction of travel for the wheel.  -Z is backwards.
The wheel rolls forward when rotating around the positive direction around the X axis.

A positive wheel steering angle corresponds to a positive rotation around the shape's Y axis.  (Castor angles are not modeled.)

The coordinate frame of the shape is rigidly fixed on the car.

\brief This class is a shape instance of a height field object of type NxHeightField.

Each shape is owned by an actor that it is attached to.

<h3>Creation</h3>

An instance can be created by calling the createShape() method of the NxActor object
that should own it, with a NxHeightFieldShapeDesc object as the parameter, or by adding the 
shape descriptor into the NxActorDesc class before creating the actor.

The shape is deleted by calling NxActor::releaseShape() on the owning actor.

Example:

\include NxHeightFieldShape_Create.cpp

\brief A height field object.  

Height fields work in a similar way as triangle meshes specified to act as height fields, with some important differences:

Triangle meshes can be made of nonuniform geometry, while height fields are regular, rectangular grids.
This means that with NxHeightField, you sacrifice flexibility in return for improved performance and decreased memory consumption.

Like Convexes and TriangleMeshes, HeightFields are referenced by shape instances of type NxHeightFieldShape.

To avoid duplicating data when you have several instances of a particular 
height field differently, you do not use this class to represent a 
height field object directly. Instead, you create an instance of this height field 
via the NxHeightFieldShape class.

<h3>Creation</h3>

To create an instance of this class call NxPhysicsSDK::createHeightField(),
and NxPhysicsSDK::releaseHeightField() to delete it. This is only possible
once you have released all of its NxHeightFiedShape instances.

Example:

\include NxHeightField_Create.cpp

\brief A Convex Mesh.

Internally represented as a list of convex polygons. The number
of polygons is limited to 256.

To avoid duplicating data when you have several instances of a particular 
mesh positioned differently, you do not use this class to represent a 
convex object directly. Instead, you create an instance of this mesh via
the NxConvexShape class.

<h3>Creation</h3><h3>Creation</h3>

To create an instance of this class call NxPhysicsSDK::createConvexMesh(),
and NxPhysicsSDK::releaseConvexMesh() to delete it. This is only possible
once you have released all of its #NxConvexShape instances.

Example:

\include NxConvexMesh_Create.cpp

	is that it is assumed to be semi-infinite along one axis, and therefore it doesn't have the problem
	of fast moving objects 'popping' through it due to temporal under sampling.

	However, height fields must be 'flat' in the sense that the projections of all triangles onto the
	height field plane must be disjoint. (If the height field vertical axis is Y, the height field plane is spanned by X and Z.)

	To create a height field, set heightFieldVerticalAxis to NX_X, NX_Y or NX_Z,

	Otherwise, if the point of contact is on a triangle with index i, then the material index is determined as:

<h3>Creation</h3>

To create an instance of this class call NxPhysicsSDK::createTriangleMesh(),

\brief This class is a shape instance of a triangle mesh object of type NxTriangleMesh.

Each shape is owned by an actor that it is attached to.

<h3>Creation</h3>

An instance can be created by calling the createShape() method of the NxActor object
that should own it, with a NxTriangleMeshShapeDesc object as the parameter, or by adding the 
shape descriptor into the NxActorDesc class before creating the actor.

The shape is deleted by calling NxActor::releaseShape() on the owning actor.

PPU: Collision detection will only be performed against mesh pages which have been mapped into
PPU memory using #mapPageInstance()

\brief A sphere shaped collision detection primitive.

Each shape is owned by an actor that it is attached to.

<h3>Creation</h3>

An instance can be created by calling the createShape() method of the NxActor object
that should own it, with a NxSphereShapeDesc object as the parameter, or by adding the 
shape descriptor into the NxActorDesc class before creating the actor.

The shape is deleted by calling NxActor::releaseShape() on the owning actor.

	\brief retrieves the plane

	Note: 
	There is an inconsistency between the definition of a plane in the 
	NxPlane class and the NxPlaneShape and NxPlaneShapeDesc classes.
	The NxPlane class defines a point (X, Y, Z) in the plane when:
		normal.x*X + normal.y*Y + normal.z*Z + d = 0
	The NxPlaneShapeDesc and NxPlaneShape::setPlane() use the following definition:
		normal.x*X + normal.y*Y + normal.z*Z - d = 0
	Although the data is the same, the interpretation is different:
	<code>
	NxPlane plane;
	NxPlaneShape *planeShape;
	...
	planeShape-&gt;setPlane(plane.normal, plane.d);
	// At this point plane == planeShape-&gt;getPlane() will be true.
	// But plane.pointInPlane() will not return a point in 'planeShape'
 	...
	// To use the plane methods the following conversions are required:
	...
	// Assignment NxPlane -&gt; NxPlaneShape
	planeShape-&gt;setPlane(plane.normal, -plane.d); 
	// 'planeShape' now represents the same plane as 'plane'
	...
	// Assignment NxPlaneShape -&gt; NxPlane
	plane = planeShape-&gt;getPlane();
	plane.d *= -plane.d;
	// 'plane' now represents the same plane as 'planeShape'

\brief Descriptor class for the D6Joint. See #NxD6Joint.

 <p>In the D6Joint, the axes are assigned as follows:
 <ul><li>x-axis = joint axis</li><li>y-axis = joint normal axis</li><li>z-axis = x-axis cross y-axis</li></ul>
 These are defined relative to the parent body (0) of the joint.</p><p>
 Swing is defined as the rotation of the x-axis with respect to the y- and z-axis.
 </p><p>
 Twist is defined as the rotation about the x-axis.

	The point is specified in the global coordinate frame.

	All types of joints may be limited with the same system:
	You may elect a point attached to one of the two actors to act as the limit point.
	You may also specify several planes attached to the other actor.

	The points and planes move together with the actor they are attached to.

	The simulation then makes certain that the pair of actors only move relative to each other 
	so that the limit point stays on the positive side of all limit planes.

	If the joint force rises above this threshold, the joint breaks, and becomes disabled. Additionally,
	the jointBreakNotify() method of the scene's user notify callback will be called.
	(You can set this with NxScene::setUserNotify()).

	There are two values, one for linear forces, and one for angular forces. Both values are used directly
	as a value for the maximum impulse tolerated by the joint constraints. 

	Both force values are NX_MAX_REAL by default. This setting makes the joint unbreakable. 
	The values should always be nonnegative.

	The distinction between maxForce and maxTorque is dependent on how the joint is implemented internally, 
	which may not be obvious. For example what appears to be an angular degree of freedom may be constrained 
	indirectly by a linear constraint.

    So in most practical applications the user should set both maxTorque and maxForce to low values.

	The most interesting values are contactPosition, contactPoint, and contactNormal. The contactPosition value
	specifies how far on the travel distance the contactPoint was found. If you want to simulate a bumpy road,
	then this is the main parameter to change. It is also good to adjust the contactPoint variable, so that the
	wheel forces are applied in the correct position.

<h3>Creation</h3>

Example material creation:
\include NxMaterial_Create.cpp

You can create a material which has different friction coefficients depending on the direction that
a body in contact is trying to move in. This is called anisotropic friction.

<h3>Anisotropic Friction</h3>

Anisotropic friction is useful for modeling things like sledges, skis etc

When you create an anisotropic material you specify the default friction parameters and also friction parameters for the V axis.
The friction parameters for the V axis are applied to motion along the direction of anisotropy (dirOfAnisotropy).

Anisotropic Material Example:
\include NxMaterial_Aniso.cpp

<h3>Default Material</h3>

You can change the properties of the default material by querying for material index 0.

Default Material Example:
\include NxMaterial_ChangeDefault.cpp

Flag that determines the combine mode. When two actors come in contact with each other, they each have
materials with various coefficients, but we only need a single set of coefficients for the pair.

Physics doesn't have any inherent combinations because the coefficients are determined empirically on a case by case
basis. However, simulating this with a pairwise lookup table is often impractical.

For this reason the following combine behaviors are available:

NX_CM_AVERAGE
NX_CM_MIN
NX_CM_MULTIPLY
NX_CM_MAX

The effective combine mode for the pair is max(material0.combineMode, material1.combineMode).

	The difference between "normal" and "strong" friction is that the strong friction feature
	remembers the "friction error" between simulation steps. The friction is a force trying to
	hold objects in place (or slow them down) and this is handled in the solver. But since the
	solver is only an approximation, the result of the friction calculation can include a small
	"error" - e.g. a box resting on a slope should not move at all if the static friction is in
	action, but could slowly glide down the slope because of a small friction error in each 
	simulation step. The strong friction counter-acts this by remembering the small error and
	taking it to account during the next simulation step.

	However, in some cases the strong friction could cause problems, and this is why it is
	possible to disable the strong friction feature by setting this flag. One example is
	raycast vehicles, that are sliding fast across the surface, but still need a precise
	steering behavior. It may be a good idea to reenable the strong friction when objects

@name Kinematic Actors

	\brief The moveGlobal* calls serve to move kinematically controlled dynamic actors through the game world.

	You set a dynamic actor to be kinematic using the NX_BF_KINEMATIC body flag,
	used either in the NxBodyDesc or with raiseBodyFlag().
	
	The move command will result in a velocity that, when successfully carried 
	out (i.e. the motion is not blocked due to joints or collisions) inside run*(),
	will move the body into the desired pose. After the move is carried out during
	a single time step, the velocity is returned to zero. Thus, you must
	continuously call this in every time step for kinematic actors so that they 
	move along a path.

	These functions simply store the move destination until run*() is called,
	so consecutive calls will simply overwrite the stored target variable.

	Note that in the future we will provide a mechanism for the motion to be blocked
	in certain cases (such as when a box jams in an automatic door), but currently
	the motion is always fully carried out.

@name Global Pose Manipulation

	\brief Methods for setting a dynamic actor's pose in the world.

	These methods instantaneously change the actor space to world space transformation. 

	One should exercise restraint in making use of these methods. 

	Static actors should not be moved at all. There are various internal data structures for static actors
	which may need to be recomputed when one moves. Also, moving static actors will not interact correctly
	with dynamic actors or joints. If you would like to directly control an actor's position and would like to 
	have it correctly interact with dynamic bodies and joints, you should create a dynamic body with the 
	NX_BF_KINEMATIC flag, and then use the moveGlobal*() commands to move it along a path!

	When briefly moving dynamic actors, one should not:
	
	\li Move actors into other actors, thus causing interpenetration (an invalid physical state)
	
	\li Move an actor  that is connected by a joint to another away from the other (thus causing joint error)

	\li When moving jointed actors the joints' cached transform information is destroyed and recreated next frame;
	thus this call is expensive for jointed actors.
	
	setGlobalPose(m) has the same effect as calling	
	setGlobalOrientation(m.M);	and setGlobalPosition(m.t); 
	but setGlobalPose() may be faster as it doesn't recompute some internal values twice.

	\brief Actor Descriptor. This structure is used to save and load the state of #NxActor objects.

	If the body descriptor contains a zero mass but the actor descriptor contains a non-zero density,
	we compute a new mass automatically from the density and the shapes.

	Static or dynamic actors:

	\li To create a static actor, use a null body descriptor pointer(and not a body with zero mass). Shapes should
	be specified for the static actor when it is created.
	If you want to create a temporarily static actor that can be made dynamic at runtime, create your
    dynamic actor as usual and use NX_BF_KINEMATIC flags in its body descriptor.

	\li To create a dynamic actor, provide a valid body descriptor with or without shape descriptors. The
	  shapes are not mandatory.

	Mass or density:
	
		To simulate a dynamic actor, the SDK needs a mass and an inertia tensor. 
		(The inertia tensor is the combination of bodyDesc.massLocalPose and bodyDesc.massSpaceInertia)

		These can be specified in several different ways:

		1) actorDesc.density == 0,  bodyDesc.mass &gt; 0, bodyDesc.massSpaceInertia.magnitude() &gt; 0

			Here the mass properties are specified explicitly, there is nothing to compute.

		2) actorDesc.density &gt; 0,	actorDesc.shapes.size() &gt; 0, bodyDesc.mass == 0, bodyDesc.massSpaceInertia.magnitude() == 0

			Here a density and the shapes are given. From this both the mass and the inertia tensor is computed.

		3) actorDesc.density == 0,	actorDesc.shapes.size() &gt; 0, bodyDesc.mass &gt; 0, bodyDesc.massSpaceInertia.magnitude() == 0

			Here a mass and shapes are given. From this the inertia tensor is computed.

		Other combinations of settings are illegal.

		When the SDK computes the inertia properties it uses the actor's shapes.  
		For each shape, the shape geometry, shape mass (or density), and shape positioning within the actor 
		are used to compute the body's mass and inertia properties.  
		
		Setting the individual masses or densities of the shapes of an actor is the most intuitive method
		to specify the mass, center of mass, and inertial properties of a multi	shape actor in order to achieve 
		correct behavior.

		If the actor body has a mass, then the computed inertial properties of the actor are scaled to the specified body mass.  
		Even then, the individual shape masses are still useful since they specify how that mass is distributed within the object.
		i.e. When specified, the actor/body mass properties have priority.

		If you specify a shape density and an actor density then the two are multiplied together to obtain the effective density
		of the actor. So if you set the density of the actor to 2 and the density of the shape to 3 then the effective density 
		of that shape will be 6.

		When the sdk computes the inertial properties the default is to also compute the center of mass.
		To specify an actor's center of mass exactly but still let the SDK compute and diagonalize the inertia 
		tensor raise NxActorDescBase::flags | NX_AF_LOCK_COM.  In this case the center of mass (bodydesc.massLocalPose.t)
		will not be overridden and the computed inertial tensor will be transformed correctly so that
		it will be as if the volume integrals for the moments had been done from the specified point.

		The NX_AF_LOCK_COM is only considered when computing the mass properties during creation, it will
		not be considered when calling NxActor::updateMassFromShapes().

	You should not use the NxActorDescBase class directly, instead use one of the derived classes,
	NxActorDesc or NxActorDesc_Template.

 The scene simulates the behavior of these objects over time. Several scenes may exist

\brief NxActor is the main simulation object in the physics SDK.

The actor is owned by and contained in a NxScene.

An actor may optionally encapsulate a dynamic rigid body by setting the body member of the
actor's descriptor when it is created. Otherwise the actor will be static (fixed in the world).

<h3>Creation</h3>
Instances of this class are created by calling #NxScene::createActor() and deleted with #NxScene::releaseActor().

See #NxActorDescBase for a more detailed description of the parameters which can be set when creating an actor.

\include NxActor_CreateStatic.cpp

Example (Dynamic Actor):

\include NxActor_CreateDynamic.cpp

	is called sleeping. However, because the object automatically wakes up when it is either touched by an awake object,
	or one of its properties is changed by the user, the entire sleep mechanism should be transparent to the user.

	This flag only has an effect if the flag NX_SBF_DAMPING is set. If set, 
	the global rigid body modes (translation and rotation) are extracted from damping. 
	This way, the soft body can freely move and rotate even under high damping.

	\brief Defines whether the soft body is tearable. 
	
	Make sure meshData.maxVertices and the corresponding buffers
	in meshData are substantially larger (e.g. 2x) than the number 
	of original vertices since tearing will generate new vertices.
	When the buffer cannot hold the new vertices anymore, tearing stops.
	If this buffer is chosen big enough, the entire mesh can be 
	torn into all constituent tetrahedral elements. 
	(The theoretical maximum needed is 12 times the original number of vertices. 
	For reasonable mesh topologies, this should never be reached though.)
	
	If the soft body is simulated on the hardware, additional buffer 
	limitations that cannot be controlled by the user exist. Therefore, soft 
	bodies might cease to tear apart further, even though not all space in 
	the user buffer is used up.

	Note: For tearing in hardware, make sure you cook the mesh with
	the flag NX_SOFTBODY_MESH_TEARABLE set in the NxSoftBodyMeshDesc.flags.

	\brief Enable/disable two way collision of the soft body with the rigid body scene.
	
	In either case, the soft body is influenced by colliding rigid bodies.
	If NX_SBF_COLLISION_TWOWAY is not set, rigid bodies are not influenced by 
	colliding with the soft body. Use NxSoftBodyDesc.collisionResponseCoefficient to
	control the strength of the feedback force on rigid bodies.

	When using two way interaction care should be taken when setting the density of the attached objects.
	For example if an object with a very low or high density is attached to a soft body then the simulation 
	may behave poorly. This is because impulses are only transfered between the soft body and rigid body solver
	outside the solvers.

	Two way interaction works best when NX_SF_SEQUENTIAL_PRIMARY is set in the primary scene. If not set,
	collision and attachment artifacts may happen.

	\brief Attaches the cloth to an actor. 
	
	\note Call this function only once right after the cloth is created.
	Turning cloth into metal and vice versa during the simulation is not recommended.

	\note This feature is well suited for volumetric objects like barrels. 
	It cannot handle two dimensional flat pieces well.
	
	After this call, the cloth is infinitely stiff between collisions and simply 
	moves with the actor. At impacts with an impact impulse greater than impulseThreshold, 
	the cloth is plastically deformed. Thus, a cloth with a core behaves like a piece of metal.

	The core actor's geometry is adjusted automatically. Its size also depends on the 
	cloth thickness. Thus, it is recommended to choose small values for the thickness.
	At impacts, colliding objects are moved closer to the cloth by the value provided in 
	penetrationDepth which causes a more dramatic collision result.

	The core actor must have at least one shape, and currently supported shapes are 
	spheres, capsules, boxes and compounds of spheres.
	It is recommended to specify the density rather than the mass of the core body. 
	This way the mass and inertia tensor are updated when the core deforms.

	The maximal deviation of cloth particles from their initial positions
	(modulo the global rigid body transforms translation and rotation) can be
	specified via the parameter maxDeformationDistance. Setting this parameter to
	zero means that the deformation is not limited.

	\param impulseThreshold Threshold for when deformation is allowed.

	In either case, cloth is influenced by colliding rigid bodies.
	If NX_CLF_COLLISION_TWOWAY is not set, rigid bodies are not influenced by

	When using two way interaction care should be taken when setting the density of the attached objects.
	For example if an object with a very low or high density is attached to a cloth then the simulation 
	may behave poorly. This is because impulses are only transfered between the cloth and rigid body solver
	outside the solvers.

	CCD is performed with a skeleton(mesh) embedded within the object, this can be simpler than the geometry 
	used for discrete collision detection. 

	NxShape::setCCDSkeleton() should be used to associate a CCD skeleton with shapes.

	\note that stray vertices are permitted (in other words, vertices not referenced by any triangles), 
	but degenerate triangles (triangles that have a triangle index 2 or 3 times) are not. Stray vertices 
	are supported so that you can use a single vertex to do a raycast style CCD test. 

	\note The CCD skeleton should be scaled so that it is smaller than the geometry it is embedded within.
	This allows regular discrete collision detection to handle resting contact. Making the CCD skeleton too
	large in comparison to the shape it is embedded within can cause erratic behavior.

	created at a given point in the simulation.

	However, scenes are built from lower-level objects called contexts. There is a limit of 64 contexts; a scene will 
	take 1 or 2 contexts depending on flags upon creation. A software scene (NX_SIMULATION_SW) will always take 1 context, 
	a hardware scene will take 1 context if NX_SF_RESTRICTED_SCENE is set, otherwise 2 contexts. This places an
	absolute limit on the maximum number of scenes regardless of the memory available.

        <member name="T:NxPruningStructure">
\brief Pruning structure used to accelerate scene queries (raycast, sweep tests, etc)

	NX_PRUNING_NONE can be used without defining extra parameters. It typically doesn't provide
	fast scene queries, but on the other hand it doesn't consume much memory. It is useful when
	you don't use the SDK's scene queries at all.

	NX_PRUNING_OCTREE usually provides fast queries and cheap per-object updates. You need
	to define "maxBounds" and "subdivisionLevel" to use this structure.

	NX_PRUNING_QUADTREE is the 2D version of NX_PRUNING_OCTREE. It is usually a better choice
	when your world is mostly flat. It is sometimes a better choice for non-flat worlds as well.
	You need to define "maxBounds", "subdivisionLevel" and "upAxis" to use this structure.

	NX_PRUNING_DYNAMIC_AABB_TREE usually provides the fastest queries. However there is a
	constant per-frame management cost associated with this structure. You have the option to
	give a hint on how much work should be done per frame by setting the parameter
	#NxSceneDesc::dynamicTreeRebuildRateHint.

	NX_PRUNING_STATIC_AABB_TREE is typically used for static objects. It is the same as the
	dynamic AABB tree, without the per-frame overhead. This is the default choice for static
	objects. However, if you are streaming parts of the world in and out, you may want to use
	the dynamic version even for static objects.

\brief This structure captures results for a single raycast query.

All members of the NxRaycastHit structure are not always available. For example when the ray hits a sphere,
the faceID member is not computed. Also, when raycasting against bounds (AABBs) instead of actual shapes,
some members are not available either. 

Some members like barycentric coordinates are currently only computed for triangle meshes and convexes, but next versions
might provide them in other cases. The client code should check #flags to make sure returned values are
relevant.

When used as hint flags in raycasting queries, those bits control what the user would like to see computed
in the NxRaycastHit structure. For example, you might tell the SDK to compute impact normals using the
NX_RAYCAST_NORMAL hint flag. It's usually faster to let the SDK do it, instead of fetching relevant data
again in the client app. However all users may not need this information. In this case, just omit this flag
and corresponding member of ::NxRaycastHit will not be computed internally - saving processing time. 

Note that NX_RAYCAST_NORMAL computes a smoothed normal, while NX_RAYCAST_FACE_NORMAL only returns the usual
normal of a triangle (i.e. the normalized cross product of two edges).

See #NxScene and #NxShape for raycasting methods.

\brief Enables kinematic mode for the actor. Enable kinematic mode for the body. Kinematic actors are special dynamic actors that are not influenced by forces (such as gravity), and have no momentum. They appear to have infinite mass and can be moved around the world using the moveGlobal*() methods. They will push regular dynamic actors out of the way. Currently they will not collide with static or other kinematic objects. This will change in a later version. Note that if a dynamic actor is squished between a kinematic and a static or two kinematics, then it will have no choice but to get pressed into one of them. Later we will make it possible to have the kinematic motion be blocked in this case. Kinematic actors are great for moving platforms or characters, where direct motion control is desired.

\brief 3 Element vector class.

This is a vector class with public data members.
This is not nice but it has become such a standard that hiding the xyz data members
makes it difficult to reuse external code that assumes that these are public in the library.
The vector class can be made to use float or double precision by appropriately defining NxReal.
This has been chosen as a cleaner alternative to a template class.

\brief 3x3 Matrix Class.

 The idea of the matrix/vector classes is to partition them into two parts:
 One is the data structure which may have different formatting (3x3, 3x4, 4x4),
 row or column major.  The other is a template class which has all the operators
 but is storage format independent.

 This way it should be easier to change formats depending on what is faster/slower
 on a particular platform.

 Design issue: We use nameless struct/unions here.
 Design issue: this used to be implemented with a template.  This had no benefit
 but it added syntactic complexity.  Currently we just use a typedef and a preprocessor switch 
 to change between different memory layouts.

 The matrix math in this class is storage format (row/col major) independent as far
 as the user is concerned.
 When the user wants to get/set raw data, he needs to specify what order the data is
 coming in.
