This class contains the crossover code from the NewModules to the Gameplay project

The Wrapper classes provide access to the NewModules API features and are accessible trough a statically, but contextually scoped variable 'TW'.

The Engine is the core class that wraps functionality and manages all resources (caches for graphics, GPU, seperate gameplay datastorage)
