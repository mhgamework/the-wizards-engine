imposter design

- in the end we must have one vertexbuffer with one texture.
in this vertexbuffer and texture there are several imposters stored.

when ever you make a render engine that must store a lot of data.
these renderData must be presented by imposter to get the proper speed.
when ever you create an new ImposterObject this must be added to the imposter engine.
this engine keeps track of them all and says when to update which one,
when you wanna render all the data you just say ImposterEngine. render



- we have to create a way where we can update one imposter without effecting the other but still try to keep them in the same mesh and texture
