This namespace allows for voxelization of meshes. The current implementation is simple:

  * For each triangle
    * For each voxel intersecting with the triangle's bounding box
	  * Create 13 principal axes for the voxel-triangle intersection
	  * Use 'separating axes theorem': Check if there is a separation between the projection of both objects on each axis
	  * If there is no separation, a voxel is set
