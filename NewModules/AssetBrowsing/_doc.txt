This namespace implements the Asset Pipeline in TheWizards

The TWDir.Assets folder contains a tree structure of all assets. 
Currently the files in this tree are 'placeholder' files that represents each asset, and contain the Asset's GUID.

When new assets are placed in the tree structure, the engine will automatically pick them up and add them to the internal system. 
If the added files need preprocessing, preprocessing happens and a asset placeholder is added to the tree, when the engine shuts down these pre-processed files are removed
