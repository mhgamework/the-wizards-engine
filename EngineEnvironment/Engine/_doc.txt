This class contains the crossover code from the NewModules to the Gameplay project

The Wrapper classes provide access to the NewModules API features and are accessible trough a statically, but contextually scoped variable 'TW'.

The Engine is the core class that wraps functionality and manages all resources (caches for graphics, GPU, seperate gameplay datastorage)

Note that this namespaces is NOT a feature namespace, like all the other NewModules namespaces. 
It contains full AL for the engine, and a wrapper for the features in NewModules that are used in the engine
