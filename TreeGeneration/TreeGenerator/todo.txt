---------tree generater:---------

-I need to create render engine for the common game,(can mainly be copied from the EditerRenderEngine)
-animation on the branches should be nice, not really necessary on the moment
-a decent lighting shader for the leaves of the tree
-there are double vertices that should be cleaned up when used for the game



---------Grass------------
-double vertices, the use of indices should be implemented
-a decent lighting shader should be implemented
-acces to the terrain so that we can y-co from the terrain to put the grass on.
